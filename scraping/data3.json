In accordance with this strategy, the government will bargain with academic publishers and other interested stakeholders to make academic resources accessible to all at a reasonable price. On the other hand, the implementation of the ONOS policy might have an effect on the endurance of library consortia, groups of libraries that collaborate to give their members accesstoacademic resources. The ONOS policy might lower the need for library consortia since some people and organisations would prefer to buy scholarly publications directly from the publishers as rather than going through a consortium. Including the government in negotiations with publishers may also result in lower subscription costs for library consortia, enhancing their long-term viability. The ONOS policy has the potential to dramatically increase access to scholarly materials in India, but it is yet too early to tell how it will affect the viability of library consortiums.",

In so doing, five (5) research questions guided the conduct of this study. This study used a descriptive survey as its research strategy. The population of this study included 1,767 postgraduate students enrolled in three universities in Nigeria’s Kogi State for the academic year 2021–2022, including federal, state-owned, and private institutions. Using the multi-stage sampling, 313 postgraduate students were from Federal, State and Private owned institutions in Kogi State. Data was analysed quantitatively using mean and standard deviation. This survey made it abundantly evident that postgraduate students seldomever use online resources which showed a detrimental effect on research, teaching, and learning. Also, the study found that, knowledge of e-resources does not equate to usage of those resources.This study is the original idea from the authors and does not reflect on any copyrighted materials. This study recommended, among others, that the library needs to make an effort to educate users and teach students so that all students are aware of how to access e-resources off-campus and faculty librarians must consider a variety of channel to increase awareness of e-resources. The limitations of this study is that, it focused on three (3) selected universities, therefore generalization of result should be done with caution. Also, the study considered only academic libraries.",

The quality of research work generated by its researchers and faculty members brings fame and laurels tothe parent institutions as well as to the nation which will subsequently serve humanity. In the contemporary academic environment, the unethical practice followed in research has been discussed enormously, posing a serious concern globally. Plagiarism is one such practice that has been reported and discussed inthe recent past.As per the academic and scholarly literature on plagiarism, the primary reason for plagiarism proliferation is the unawareness, misconception, and attitude of the research scholarsand faculty members toward it.The present study isan attempt to measure awareness of plagiarism in academics, methods, tools and techniques adopted to counter plagiarism among faculty members and research scholars of three central universities in Uttar Pradesh viz. Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Banaras HinduUniversity (BHU), Babasaheb BhimraoAmbedkar University, Lucknow (BBAU). The study followed the survey method using a structured questionnaire for data collection using a random sampling method. The study aims to identify and analyze the different aspect under awareness including the requirement of anti-plagiarism software before submitting a research paper or thesis for submission, the source of plagiarism awareness, the difference between similarity and plagiarism. The study reveals and reports the methods, tools and techniques used to avoid plagiarism like paraphrasing, similarity detection tools, reference managers, using quotations wherever required, attending awareness programs, etc. The study finds that despite awareness of plagiarism there is a need to conduct more awareness and training programs.",

            "abstract": "Collection development is a universal process for all types of libraries. Accordingly the workflow in the process is also universal. Therefore, on the basis of collection development practices of the institutions, acquisition module in library management software is developed as workflow in the section plays an important role while programming. Any change in the workflow, the libraries have local variation and they give for customization. Increasing size of the service community correspond to increase in degree of divergence in individual information need. The user’s need survey is very necessary to understand the needs of the community. Different committees and commission reports advice for the percentage of budget allocation for academic libraries. Library budget is major factor in the collection development policy. The role of Inter-Library-Loan (ILL) is the product of library co-operation, which controls the expenditure during budget constraints. There are hundreds and thousands of libraries and information centers with excellent and rare collections. But there is no Indian Standard for development of collection development policy in the instructional level. A policy statement provides a framework within which individual can exercise their own judgments and actions. The approved policy of the institutions provides clarity and consistence to the collection development strategies through internal workflow in both manual and automated environment.The author, on the basisofher vastexperience in thefield tries to bring the parameters for the policy. The parameters may or may not be applicable to all types of libraries. It depends on the size of user community, the institutional need and need of the procedure. The workflow of the particular section sources certain process but behind the screen a lot of parameters are involved. The author hopes the use of parameters in different types of libraries for various types of resources on the basis of their format. However, in the age of IT the tangible and intangible items have different features—their procurement, usages, and weeding out.",

It looks at the research on how libraries can support learning management systems in a classroom setting. It examines the objective of libraries, their services, and learning management systems. It also focuses on the LMS research trends, its possible expansion into library services, andits hurdles in the academic context. The PRISMA technique is used to prepare the systematic review. We incorporated LMS papers that have a direct bearing on the provision of library services. Published in English over the previous years in the LMS and library services fields. A UNESCO report-2021 on education was also added to enhance its scope. 47 literature materials, including additional resources, published on LMS and the application of LMS inlibraries were reviewed and analyzed for this study. The concept’s overall investigation reveals that many academic institutions have started using LMS at various sites to build libraries to improve students’ learning activities. Based on certain research, it was challenging to adopt the LMS in the educational sector due to a lack of ICT expertise, financial constraints, and hostility among teaching staff towards the system. There are various techniques for libraries to include LMS in their services. Overall, the LMS actively engages with students’ expectations for online learning and helps them stay updated on their academic progress. LMS is giving instructors and teachers more advantages, particularly in the thoughtful organization of educational content. The obvious progression from the conventional idea of incorporating library materials into course content is to integrate library assets into course content.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of new technologies in the 21st century has redefined the way human beings have interacted in public and private spaces. Today, if we want to book a cab, we can easily book the same using our mobile phone within a few seconds if we exclude the human side of delay/error or if we are supposed to commute through other means of public transport such as the metro, we can use smart cards. In terms of performance do we notice any difference? The computing, processing, and operations are done within the blink of an eye. The time taken to complete such tasks is nearly the same but they use different underlying connectivity technologies and through these technologies, mobility and interactions are being redefined. Well, the convenient connectivity technologies for mobile devices with high battery and processing power in current trends of this era are cellular, simply put 3G, 4G, and 5G. However, small or microdevices that may only use sensors or may have limited power and processing cannot be categorized as other mobile devices like smartphones, laptops, PDAs, etc. In the past couple of decades, humans have become the minority as the generator and the receiver of traffic over the Internet. Much of the communication is done in a machine-to-machine manner and this communication has been reshaped by the Internet. If we are to define the Internet, simply put it is the network of computers. However, the Internet of Things on the other hand can be said as the network of “things” or devices or physical “objects”, that may be connected over the Internet. At the same time, the scope of IoT is much broader than the Internet as it covers the dimension of connecting physical objects like fans, air conditioners, lighting systems, surveillance cameras, etc. What has IoT to offer and why IoT is so popular in this era? The IoT offers an advanced level of services where we can connect embedded systems, computing platforms, nanotechnology, etc., all working as independent nodes. Unlike Computers, small sensor-based devices or “things” require a connectivity technology that consumes low power and energy and transmits limited data. Some examples are ZigBee, NFC, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN, BLE, etc. This is what makes them different from smartphones which consume comparatively higher power and processing. No doubt, due to the increase in the number of connected devices the shortage of addressing also becoming a problem as currently, we use IPv4 and IPv6 addressing for the Internet Protocol and since the active devices are already over 10 billion in count we will soon or later run out of addresses. One example is how the current IPv4 infrastructure is used to transmit IPv6 data, as the internet backbone follows IPv4 addressing so one has to translate the IPv6 address into an IPv4 one. Likewise, discussion about the current solution to this problem and what are the limitations of current addressing methods and future scope.",

The required data has been collected from the Scopus database. To make the collected data analysis-ready, essential data transformation was performed manually and with the help of a tool viz. OpenRefine. For determining the trend and performing the mapping techniques, top five open access and commercial journals of AI have been chosen based on their citescore driven ranking. The work includes 6880 articles published in the specified period for analysis. The trend is based on Country-wise publications, year-wise publications, topical terms in AI, top-cited articles, prominent authors, major institutions, involvement of industries in AI and Indian appearance. The results show that compared to open access journals; commercial journals have a higher citescore and number of articles published over the years. Additionally, IEEE is the prominent publisher which publishes 84% of the top-cited publications. Further, China and the United States are the major contributors to literature in the AI domain. The study reveals that neural networks and deep learning are the major topics included in top AI research publications. Recently, not only public institutions but also private bodies are investing their resources in AI research. The study also investigates the relative position of Indian researchers in terms of AI research.

            "abstract": "The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the cutting-edge Assistive Technologies (AT) hardware devices that are useful for academic libraries to amalgamate Visually Impaired (VI) users into the mainstream of library services. In addition, the study also advocates and promotes the use of AT hardware devices in academic libraries, especially in developing nations, as the best possible solution for providing equitable access to information to VI users. This study found that only a few academic libraries in India have integrated a few essential ATs in the library to facilitate VI users. Consequently, most VI users are not getting equitable access to library resources and services, creating a wide gap between the availability of information in the public domain and its accessibility to VI users. The study enlists some AT hardware devices and their tentative costing, features and names of the vendors or suppliers, which may be very useful for academic libraries in procuring suitable AT devices and providing equitable access to library resources to VI users. This study focuses on AT hardware devices useful for VI users in academic libraries. The study highlights some state-of-the-art AT hardware devices that may create awareness among academic libraries interested in introducing suitable AT hardware devices for VI users. This study will be helpful for traditional libraries in the transition phase of becoming inclusive libraries and at the edge of finalising AT solutions to open their doors to VI users. This paper will also give library professionals an innovative idea on the latest AT hardware devices available in the market and would be a boon for improving the accessibility and usability of library resources for VI users.",

The Technology Acceptance model was used to underpin the study. The population of the study is 150 nurses from three purposively selected hospitals in the country. The hospitals were selected because they have necessary ICT resources and human resources to operate nursing informatics technologies. Simple random sampling was used to select 30 nurses from each of the hospitals. Questionnaire was used as data collection instrument. The findings revealed that mobile health technology is the most used nursing informatics and prevention of medical errors is the main reason for using nursing informatics among nurses. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence the nurses to use the technologies. The study recommended that the hospitals managements should make funds available in order to have modern days nursing informatics. Furthermore, in design or making of technologies for nurses’ usability, the technologies should be user-friendly and easy to use for effective medical practices. However, the research joined the discussion and validations of TAM and nursing informatics in the context of Nigeria. According to the researchers’ understanding, this study appears to be the first of its sort to examine TAM and nursing informatics in Nigeria. The study also adds to the body of knowledge and offers new information on the significance of nursing informatics for decision-makers in Nigerian healthcare facilities.",

In this scenario, libraries played a pivotal in extending reference and research services to its clientele through various mechanisms. Remote access to electronic resources is one of such mechanisms. The present study is an attempt to know diverse patterns of accessing electronic resources through remote access software during pandemic by users of a Law University based in India namely National Law University Delhi (NLUD). The study also aims to analyze the frequency of referred electronic resources during pandemic on various parameters such as most referred legal database, maximum number of downloads, maximum number of logins, content based logins and downloads for various legal databases from the perspective of different user categories. The data for the present study has been extracted from the remote access software namely Remote Xs subscribed by the university. The Study finds that post graduate students are the major users among different user categories accessing the electronic resources through remote access mechanisms during the lockdown period. The study also reveals that among various electronic resource categories, the most popular category were e-journals. Apart from this, most referred Indian legal database was Manupatra and JSTOR was the most popular International legal database.",

Various commercial and open-source software for different functions of the library is available in the market. Librarians often face issues in determining if they go for commercial software or open-source software or a hybrid model where both software are used. The current study aims to explore the various impacting factors that influence librarians’ decision and choice of the software for different functions of the library. The current study tests different hypotheses made by the researcher to validate if age, qualifications, experience and gender of the librarians have any impact on their decision in choosing software for their libraries. This is a quantitative study based on data collected through questionnaire among a target segment of librarians working in private sector management institutions in Noida and Ghaziabad areas of the Uttar Pradesh, India. Both descriptive and inferential data analyses conducted using SPSS software. The results of the data analysis revealed that age, qualifications, experience and gender of the librarians actually have direct impact on choice of the software among respondent libraries, however, gender and experience of the librarian had a significant impact on the choice of the software made by them. Women librarians showed higher level of trust on commercial software and more librarians from both genders having over 10 years plus experience were ready to experiment and trying open-source software than the librarians with lesser experience. The outcome of this study can become groundwork for a further detailed study encompassing all type of libraries in all geographical regions to determine if the results hold true among all librarians and for all types of libraries.",

The study investigated the resources and accessibility of the LIS services and other special materials of these libraries. For the purpose of conducting the present study, a survey of the specially-abled users was conducted, including interviews of them for the authentication of data to produce the actual findings of the study. In fact, this type of user needs specially designed and developed customised LIS services and needs to develop adequate infrastructural facilities for the delivery of library services to them in the most effective and efficient manner. The study suggested improving the existing ICT infrastructure, especially the internet facilities of all the three libraries under study.",

Various bibliometrics and scientometrics tools like VOS Viewer and Biblioshiny are used to analyse the extensive bibliographic metadata (research articles, case study, reports and review articles) which was retrieved from Web of Science core collection database for detecting Covid-19 using image processing techniques This research work demonstrates the rapid increase of Covid-19 during 2020–22. It considered 606 documents published in 333 sources by 3668 authors from 78 different countries. The citations for different countries, co-citations for the different sources, cooccurrence of keywords, and co-authorship of the countries were determined. Further, it was found that only 3 out of 78 countries were responsible for contributing more on detection of Covid-19 using image processing related research output. These findings are critical for academics, clinicians, journal editors, and those engaged in Covid-19 detection using image processing research to understand the present literature's strengths and potential gaps, as well as to plan future data collection and science policy investments.",

Data was collected through survey method with the help of a structured questionnaire including closed ended and open ended questions. The study results were tabulated and analysed with descriptive statistics methods like Pearson's Chi Square Testing. The findings reveal that majority of Indian MPs (92.4%) collect and are already aware of information on arts and culture in their area and interact with people through social gatherings to know the societal needs of their constituency/region. The majority of art and cultural programmes are organised at local and state level in all the regions and very few programmes are organised at national and international level. There is availability of art and cultural Centre(s) in almost all the regions of India to perform various cultural activities. It is also found that the art and cultural information is a part of course/curriculum in school, college and university education system in India. The study concludes that art and cultural information is an integral part of life in the society.",

Disparate pieces of information in the form of metadata have the potential to form and depict meaningful relationships as useful sources of information. Organizing and structuring disparate pieces of information is primarily done by knowledge managers, taxonomists and ontologists across organizations. Ranganathan gave library science its own vocabulary, “facet”, “isolate”, “phase”, “focus” that are used for technical services. Facet analysis is a process that involves analysis of a subject or a domain into its facets based on a set of postulates, canons and principles. This article throws light on the application of facet analysis for developing knowledge organization tools such as contemporary e-commerce product taxonomies and ontologies. Facet analysis is designed on the core idea of the natural way of thinking and understanding information. This study traces the relevance and importance of Ranganathan's approaches of classification as a basis in developing taxonomies and ontologies.",

The closing of all educational institutions and shift to online teaching and learning has led to increase in the use of electronic resources. During this pandemic, it has been realized that awareness and use of e-resources is must for all categories of users. The faculty members and researchers are two important categories of users who are continuously engaged in teaching, learning and research. An attempt is made in the present study to explore the awareness and use of e-resources among faculty members and researchers of Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak. The main objectives of the study are to investigate the awareness and use of e-resources, identify the types of e-resources used, adopted search strategies, level of satisfaction about e-resources and the problems faced by faculty members and researchers while using e-resources.This study is based on primary data collected from faculty members and researchers using a self-designed questionnaire. The study found that all the respondents were aware about e-resource and majority of respondents were using e-resources. Maximum respondents use e-resources for their research work. Majority of respondents said that they use ‘title’ always while accessing e-resources. Only 21% respondents admitted that they faced difficulty in finding relevant information when using e-resources. Most of respondents suggested that workshops/training programmes should be organized frequently for increasing the use of e-resources.",

The main aim of this paper is to examine the existing status of infrastructural facilities in selected school libraries in Varanasi, India. A comparative analysis of schools affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (central board) and Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad (state board) is also done in the paper on the basis of quantitative and qualitative data obtained during the study. Survey method is used to for the study, hence questionnaire method is applied to collect the data. Proportionate stratified sampling is applied on the population under study. Questionnaires are distributed to school librarians selected for the study. The data obtained is analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences and Microsoft Excel. Schools affiliated to CBSE are providing more library facilities and services than schools affiliated to UPMSP. The number of schools providing basic infrastructural facilities is more in CBSE affiliated schools than in UPMSP affiliated schools. Financial condition and lack of awareness towards library development is the main hurdle in uplifting the standard of library facilities in secondary schools of Varanasi. Findings of this study will help in diminishing the gap of service expectation and status of library infrastructural facilities in school libraries.",

The present researchers found that many academic libraries overcome these problems to conduct the Shared Print Repository programme. The researchers very carefully studied the procedures, policies, and MoUs of the shared print repositories globally. It was foundout that to overcome these problems there is a need of collaboration among libraries, to develop a centralised collection development policy, regularly evaluate the collection weed out, and conduct the shared print repository programme for the least used library materials. The current practice of shared print repository shows the future of opportunity, growth and development. It is clear that in order to keep libraries active and serviceable in the future, libraries must collaboratively conduct the shared print repository programme for the least used print materials on regional, state, country and continent level.",

            "abstract": "Information literacy refers to the abilities of an individual in identifying, surfing, retrieving, and utilising appropriate information effectively to satisfy the need. The article attempts to examine the information literacy of teacher trainees at colleges of education. The researcher selected one college randomly in Jammu city. For data collection, a self-prepared questionnaire was framed and distributed among 150 teacher trainees. Out of 150 copies of questionnaire, 118 were received back from 6 male and 112 female teacher trainees respectively. It is observed that majority (81%) of the teacher trainees have knowledge of simple search techniques compared to the other search technique. Based on the findings, necessary suggestions were made by the researcher for providing effective and proper information literacy among teacher trainees. The result of the study reflects that information literacy program should be incorporated in the course curriculum and more awareness is required among students on online databases and digital resources that will make the students more information literate. Users need awareness regarding the use of Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) in the search and retrieval of information and also needs awareness about different search strategies.",

            "abstract": "The past century has witnessed mankind indulging in such acts that changed its very own perception of the world around it. The two defining wars the race to destroy its very own subsistence, realization of its folly and the halfhearted measures through timid structures to mend something without clarity, introduced humans to a new world. This new world was its own making, but it dictated terms to its own creator. It encouraged mechanization and cultivated for its author, an insatiable appetite for electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). An appetite so colossal, that it challenged to devour the very environment that sustained its own creator. Today the test is so substantial that it stands knocking at the door of every nation on the face of the earth. The Report by the Global E-waste Monitor 2020 meticulously examines every facet and sincerely demonstrates the gravity of the crisis. The said Report rather unflatteringly designates India the third position just behind the USA and China in generating e-waste in appalling quantities. This evil has stretched its reach in such an assertive posture, that today while it finds its mention in every important policy papers of all developed and developing nations, it also finds its way into every basement and trash bins lining those very same nations. India faces a two-fold dilemma in this arena, for the complexity intensifies because of the imports of e-waste from developed nations while India grapples with the concerns of its disposal within its national territory. The inadequate techniques are not only inept but pose serious environmental and health hazards. This article makes a modest endeavour to delve into this territory, exploring the national and international legal framework, its bearing on the Human health and ecosystem. Further the article makes an attempt to measure the footprint of this rapidly expanding menace with a reference to the initiatives launched to combat it. The article aims at illuminating various components of this dilemma particularly studying it from an Indian perspective.",

Their information needs vary from basic information on a given topic to information for cross verification of facts, supporting evidence in the form of photos, and public opinion. News apps, e-newspapers, digital archives of newspapers, television news channels and social networking sites are the most frequently consulted e-sources of information. Subject experts, local political leaders/government representatives, and friends and relatives are the major human sources of information consulted for gathering information. Nonavailability of the required information, lack of time, lack of information search skills and lack of information in the required language are the major problems faced while accessing information in their libraries. Lack of qualified library staff, disorganized information resources and lack of ICT facilities in the library are also the major hurdles faced while accessing the required information.",

Relevant resources are procured for use by the users. The process of library acquisition has witnessed a drastic change in recent times due to factors like digitalization, financial disruptions, various modes of delivery etc. The purpose of the present research is to understand the factors affecting acquisition policies of libraries of central universities and CFTIs. Literature review for the study was done from reputed databases like Emerald, Taylor and Francis and Web of Science and a Prisma model was developed to narrow down the literature review process. NVivo was used to understand the literature gap with TreeMap and Word cloud. A structured closed ended questionnaire having components related to acquisition was sent to library staff in the ranks of librarian, deputy librarian and assistant librarian for primary data collection. Descriptive statistics was applied to understand the demographic data and comprehend the importance of various components of acquisition. A comparative analysis was done with respect to the two types of institutions-centrally funded technical institutions and central universities. The conclusion of the research work is that the library staff of centrally funded technical institutions and central universities have different preferences for the factors affecting acquisition. The library staff of centrally funded technical institutions had the top priority for ‘ease of acquisition’ whereas their counterparts in central universities looked for ‘significance of the resources’ the most.",

It looks into the various issues that are involved in the provision of library and information services to the visually impaired students in the libraries. The study employed survey method of research and data was collected from chief librarians of six central university libraries namely, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jawaharlal Nehru University, University of Delhi, Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University and Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University by using a structured questionnaire. Findings revealed that all the libraries have provision of services to visually impaired persons but there is a lack of dedicated budget and accessibility policy for such users in the libraries. Aligarh Muslim University Library has the highest collection of braille books and daisy books followed by Delhi University library. Services such as audio book recording, transcription service and scanning assistance are available in most of the libraries. Further, it is revealed that the libraries of JNU and BBAU are fully accessible to the visually impaired persons, while the other university libraries lack some such arrangements. However basic facilities such as ramps and accessible washrooms are available in all the libraries. The study also revealed the barriers faced by the librarians in providing the special services to visually impaired persons. It is found that inadequate funds is the major barrier in provision of library services to visually impaired persons followed by the lack of reading materials in accessible format and lack of trained staff to serve such users.",

In this age of electronic revolution and the internet, printed book still dominates the scenario. The paper begins with a brief history of the records of human communication beginning with the Paleolithic cave drawings to printed books, especially emphasizing the evolution of the ‘codex&x2019; form of the book. It reveals the ‘anatomy&x2019; of the book, narrowing down to the ‘book spine&x2019; and its printing. Dwelling up on the structure and information content of the book spine, it discusses some of the associated design issues as well. When books are stacked up or stored on the shelf of a library or bookshop, the details on the spine is the only visible surface containing the information about the book that attracts the patron or buyer. It has been noticed that different styles of printing are followed in different parts of the world depending upon the culture and writing systems being followed. As many libraries hold multilingual collections, such variant spine printing styles make quick and easy identification of shelved publications difficult. International and nationals standards have tried to resolve this problem but without much success. Literature search also revealed that the debate is inconclusive and alive till date. Finally, it provides a glimpse of the innovative form of art called ‘book spine poetry.’",

This study has been undertaken to identify the policies, requirements and guidelines related to data management and sharing of the Indian research funding agencies regarding research data generated in funded research. Data was collected from the websites of 73 major research funding agencies in India irrespective of discipline. Information from their stated policies guidelines was extracted to identify references related to data sharing, data management, data policies, Data Management Plan (DMP), data deposit and public access. The study findings indicate that 05 research funding agencies/central ministries, Govt. of India have formal policies and guidelines for RDM and sharing. Further analysis of the policies was conducted to identify the coverage, guidelines and data repository elements included. The study findings help in giving better insights for identifying the gap among the available data policies in India with a special reference to the need for developing more policies and guidelines.",

The data has been collected by using questionnaires with the adoption of simple random sampling. Findings of the study show that a majority of the international tourists visit these places for understanding cultural heritage or for holidaying, while their Indian counterparts pay their visit as part of the educational program, visiting friends and/or relatives. Google is the most preferred search engine to collect travel-related information. Lonelyplanet.com and Trip Advisor.com were largely used by international tourists whereas Makemytrip.com was the most preferred by Indian tourists to make their travel arrangements, including transportation and accommodation. It is clear from the findings that International tourists depend mainly on web-based information sources, while Indian tourists rely on informal sources of information. Hence, it is necessary for the Government of Karnataka and private tour operators to host comprehensive tourists’ information on the web and establish 24 x 7 x 365 Information Helpline, and Information Kiosks exclusively for tourists to create a tourist-friendly environment.",

The universities covered in the study are central and deemed universities of Delhi and NCR, selected from NIRF 2017 of MHRD. The in-depth review of literature helped in preparing the tools for the study. Content analysis of websites of university libraries helped to find out the ICT enabled information services being facilitated by the universities under study. The survey using a structured questionnaire helped in the collection of users data. Out of the many ICT enabled information services facilitated by the selected libraries, only five ICT enabled information services were selected through content analysis of websites. The five selected services were used to compare user awareness. The authors collected data into two categories, which were 'Aware' & 'Not aware'. The Google spreadsheet was used as a statistical tool to analyse data and represent it pictorially. The study findings revealed that a higher number of percentage of users of deemed university libraries (84.80%) are aware of the selected information services in comparison to (69.88%) users of central universities. In the category of 'not aware', the higher percentage of responses (30.12%) are from central universities in comparison to deemed universities (15.20%). It highlights that users of central university libraries are less aware of the ICT enabled information services. These are lagging behind in making their users aware in comparison to deemed university libraries by a margin of (14.92%). The scenario needs to be addressed by central university libraries.",

In the 21st century rapid growth of ICT applications in academics and research has created a high-tech environment in research data management. Reference management tools help a researcher to create, organize, store and share data with other researchers. They help to make more accurate and systematic references/citations compared to traditional manual systems. Currently, many reference management tools are freely available on internet but the more popular reference management tools are Mendeley, End Note, Ref Works, Bib Desk, Zotero, Reference Manager and Referencer etc.. The author describes the role of Mendeley as a reference manager and different steps of managing research data by the researchers. The key benefits as well as major challenges associated with the use of these tools were also discussed. The study recommends that research institutions and universities should make an effort to acquire these tools and conduct awareness programs for the new researchers regularly.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this brief paper is to look back and see how the subject classification practice was taught by Late Professor C P Vashishth in the University of Delhi. Two most famous manuals i.e Colon Classification and Dewey Decimal Classification were in the curricula. The teacher adopted the most effective method ‘practice based learning’ in the classroom with patience and devotion. The students mostly post graduates were encouraged to express their views and learn the subject in a friendly and participatory environment. Two important components of LIS education i.e. classification and cataloguing dominated the library world during the 1970’s. The importance of these two subjects has waned in the recent years largely due to dominance of Internet based library services",

The significance of the public library, especially in mass literacy and in informing people regarding the nation and government is beyond dispute. Nevertheless, what if there exists the least communication between society and the library? While government (both central and state) is so committed about accomplishing goals of public welfare, why still basic illiteracy clings to village people? Is there a major breach between govt. institutions and their public reach? Most importantly, how much the local student fraternity are aware of or access public library? To investigate few such issues, A field research was conducted on few villages at the vicinity of Varanasi. Following the survey method, each data have been sampled and evaluated for the optimal utilization to diagnose the problems and to suggest some efficient methods to overcome those obstacles for constructing a better society, a better nation.",

Technology has overpowered the manual systems of various house-keeping operations of the libraries. With the advent of smartphones or android phones, librarians are forced to provide the notifications of the libraries on the android phones of the patrons-be it catalogue, any new service or transaction details or otherwise. Like other service sectors such as Bank, Airlines, etc. libraries are forced to adopt new technologies and serve their users in a better way by making use of the technology. Libraries are forced to adopt the required transformation in their look, services in a better positive way. Modern techniques have become more indispensible for quick and prompt services as users are very demanding and their patience level is very low. A properly computerized library helps in expeditious retrieval and dissemination of information as well as other library services in smoother and more efficient way. Acquisition section is one of the most important sections of the library which deals with the procurement of documents and their efficiency and promptness reflects the related activities of the libraries. By implementing acquisition module of Koha in the section, Rabindra library could integrate all the activities of the library more effectively and efficiently and make its patrons more satisfied. This paper mainly projects a case study of acquisition module of Koha and its implementation in Rabindra Library, Assam University, Silchar.",

The paper tries to assess the purpose and scope of the use of institutional repository software in libraries. Andhra Pradesh had a total of fifty autonomous engineering colleges up to academic year 2018–19 as per UGC (https://ugc.ac.in/subpage/Autonomous_Colleges.aspx)1, out of which, five are government autonomous engineering colleges, and the remaining 45 are under private management. The forty five private autonomous engineering college libraries were selected for the study. Open form questionnaire was mailed to all the librarians for a free response in the respondents own words. The questionnaire related to resources available in the institutional repository software among the college libraries. Primary data were received from eight colleges on appointment visit, fifteen colleges sent it by post, eighteen colleges sent by e-mail and four colleges did not respond. The response rate was 91 percent. Out of 41 colleges only 13(31%) colleges were maintaining institutional repository software out of which 5 are using open source software, 8, in-house developed software and no one uses commercial software. The study suggests needful and helpful findings for librarians to make and implement institutional repository software in their colleges.",

            "abstract": "Previously research was dependent more on print form for disseminating institutional research output, but after the development of digital technologies like Institutional repositories, researchers of every organizations are now in a better position to share their intellectual scholarly research output to the digital world in a fast, easy and convenient way. Institutional repository is one of the model of open access which improves the visibility of an organization globally. This paper aims to analyze the current status of the two countries India and China which are registered in the Open Directory of Open Access Repository (OpenDOAR). During this study, it was found that, 79 repositories are from India and 40 repositories are from China out of 119 repositories. The major achieving content is journals articles 96 (166%) in China 37 (92%) and India 59 (74%). The study also found that most of the open access repositories are institutional repositories from India 67 (85%) and China 39 (97%) followed by disciplinary, aggregating and governmental.",

The ability to produce and use information effectively is thus a vital source of skills for citizens of the world. As India is moving towards information and knowledge-based society, it must be necessary for university students, research scholars and faculty members to possess competencies and information literacy skills to accomplish their research goals. Information literacy(IL) is becoming an increasingly important component of the higher educational curriculum, with many disciplines incorporating elements of information literacy training within their traditional teaching. This article will highlight on necessity and importance of information literacy in higher education.",

Emergence of new technologies and tools turn the world into a global village where the main driving force is knowledge. Librarians are facing several challenges in managing huge information.

            "abstract": "This study examines information resources in both forms i.e. print and non-print and services in Fine Arts Colleges and Art Galleries. To conduct the study, a survey was made, and structured interview was also conducted with the Librarian/Head of the institution of select libraries in India. From the findings of the study, it reveals that most of libraries/institution have good collection of print as well as non print materials. For automated services in the library, it was found that only four libraries out of twelves libraries selected are using library automation software. Except IGNCA no one is using digital library software in the area of art.",

There are eleven (11) such schools in the division spread over the districts and only Jhargram district has no such special school. The study reveals that the institutes meant for the visually challenged should increase access, availability and funding for assistive technology through efforts and initiatives. Only one institute Vivekananda Mission Asram (VMA) uses sufficient Braille resources and Assistive technology. It has been revealed from the study that due to improper information about the assistance from the Government level (both Central and State) these institutes are suffering from shortage of funds. Also shortage of teaching faculty in these institutes is another hindrance in the overall development of the visually challenged students. Only in two institutes, VMA and AAHS trained librarians are recruited to run the library. The study also focuses that only in 5 institutes out of the 11 institutes the visually challenged students are very much satisfied with at least one service of the library.",

The study found that Brazil is world's most prolific producer of leishmaniasis research and has the second lowest international collaboration rate among the countries. USA was the top partner for India, showing 68 co-affiliated papers with India. Salton's measures clearly indicate that India's strongest mutual collaborative partner is Belgium (0.124) and then USA (0.084). On USA's side, Salton's measure for Brazil was highest (0.157). Out of 68 paper, 59% were bilateral (involving only India and USA) and 29 multilateral (involving other countries also with India and USA. A highly significant difference observed in CPP for domestic Indian papers (listing India-affiliated researchers only) was 6.0 and for domestic USA papers 9.34. For papers listing both Indian and USA authors (international or multilateral China-Canada collaborations) the CPP was 138.44. Thus, collaboration with USA dramatically increases the average citation rate for India-based researchers. Prolific institution, journal and author were discussed for Indo-US collaborated papers.",

The investigator made a personal survey of seven sampled universities for collecting data about the questions under investigation and questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. The investigator also had a face to face interaction with respondents to substantiate the responses and remove ambiguities thereof. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to make analysis of the data on empirical basis. Chi Squared (χ2) Test was used to derive association between the variables and test the level of significance thereof. It is explored that the ‘search engines’ and ‘university webpage’ are the most popular search platforms among users of the agricultural libraries of northern India. The newly emerged platforms i.e. ‘remote access software’ and ‘federated search engines’ have not yet become popular among users of surveyed libraries. ‘Google’ proves to be the number one search engine and ‘Yahoo’ is seen to be used by 20.00% of users. The ’Title’, and ‘Keyword/Subject Term’ happen to be much popular than other search approaches and a good percentage of respondents approach information through ‘Author’.",

            "abstract": "This study is an attempt to analyse the websites of 17 Private universities in Delhi NCR at macro level using a 12 checkpoint indicator. The paper goes on to analyse the usability checkpoints, to identify the similarities, differences, and gaps in displaying various information content on the web pages; and to highlight the role of librarians in information organization on the websites of university libraries. The check points wise analysis shows that most frequently sought after features viz. FAQ, Formatting, Announcements, Staff details with contact numbers whereas updation details have almost been neglected. One may argue that some of the information is available only for bonafide members over intranet but even then provision of at least some indicative information can promote the visibility of the websites. There are researchers outside the university looking for some basic data about the library resources, and services. For them the availability and access to required information on library website is the most convenient and reliable source. Only three universities have achieved average score for the presence of different checkpoints. From these observations the paper moves on to analyse and suggest ways to increase the visibility of the institutions and the role libraries play in aiding the increase of visibility. The role of librarian is of utmost importance as they only can take initiative by convincing the administration about a full fledged exclusive dynamic website where its services and resources are to be brought to the notice of all types of users besides their effective and efficient use. It should not be forgotten that this is the first and only source of information for most of the users before they physically visit the libraries. With a view to increasing visibility of the institution, librarians have to play the crucial role of creation and developing library websites in consultation and cooperation with all stake holders like administrators, IT professionals, and the users. To go a step further, librarians should adopt various strategies like designing an online feedback mechanism on a regular basis so that maximum utilization of electronic information services is achieved in an efficient and effective manner.",

The present article is an attempt to explore the views/works on the constituent components of human resource development in various organisations in India and abroad. Comprehensive review of related literature is done and is divided into seven components identified to study Human resource development policies existing in various organisations like Human Resource Planning, Recruitment and Selection, Placement and Induction and Promotion and Motivation. Review starts with select writings on HRD/HRM component in general. The extensive search of literature indicates that HRD is just not the employer-employee relationship, but it is much more than that. It is actually directly related to the job of the individual and finally what we learn from the literature is that the development of any organization is possible if we show more concern to human resources while at the same time constant changes at the organizational level makes it difficult for employees to cope.",

            "abstract": "Libraries generate and collect an enormous amount of data regarding usage statistics, circulation, visitor counts, budget, resource sharing data, Inter-Library Loan transactions, Document delivery statistics, etc. This collected data is interpreted for making policy decisions over library development and for the improvement of existing library services. Traditionally, libraries have been presenting the data using archaic tools such as simple graphics, tables, and charts. The recent phenomenon of Information Visualisation has provided tools and techniques for displaying information in innovative and creative ways to present abstract data. Considering the potential of Information visualisation, the tools and techniques provided by the field of Information visualisation should be exploited by the library and information centres for the presentation of library data. This paper presents an overview of various free and open source software tools available for better implementation of information visualisation in libraries for better decision making.",

The wide spectrum of collaboration and interaction among the scientists and academia within the campus has extended further so that the research and research outcomes are shared globally. Conventionally it was done through research publications, and later through digital libraries and online repositories. These platforms fulfil the idea of sharing and reuse of data, but an exclusive platform for collaborative and collective representation of academic informatics is the need of the hour. This paper explains the features of an innovative and cost effective model for sharing and re-use of academic informatics developed by Cochin University of Science & Technology (CUSAT).",

Thus it is natural that greater attention is being paid in the academics and research institutions for the same and of late several platforms have emerged to support data deposits. Data repositories are the archives which hold research data and make them publicly available so that other researchers can reuse them for their re-purposing. Also depositing data in a repository ensures the long term preservation and availability. It may be important to know which type of repository and what kind of service best supports data repository. This study tries to evaluate the two data repository softwares-Dataverse and CKAN. The paper while delineating the general background about data repository and digital repository, it focuses on the importance of data repositories. The two softwares are discussed in general along with their features, followed by their evaluation based on some important identified criteria. The study concludes with the findings, along with preferential situation based on the software suitability",

Now a person can access any type of data regarding the biological specimens from anywhere at anytime and also multiple specimens can be accessed across museums at a time.The natural history of India is rich. Fossil evidence suggests that different types of species from early invertebrates to dinosaurs once roamed the seas, air and land of this country. But the effort of digitizing these specimens are very less. So, it is extremely difficult for scientists, researchers, teachers, students and commoners to access these data from anywhere at anytimeThis paper focuses on what are the specimens that can be digitized in different natural history collections across India. Besides, attempt has been made to figure out what biological metadata schemas can be used for accessing and exchanging the digitized data",

The 2015 JIFs and ESs are obtained from Journal Citation Report® (JCR) through WoS and the SJR from the SCImago Journal and country rank website. Efforts were made to relate JIF, SJR, ES and H5 quality indices for ranking and rating quality of sports science journals. Similarly, correlations between indices were depicted by using SPSS Pearson's and Spearman's statistical correlations. Considered sports science journals have the leading standard of quality as being indexed in marked and esteemed databases such as: Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. JIF ranged between 0.163 to 6.724; ES varied between 0.0002 to 0.0416, JSR oscillated between 0.134 to 3.333 and H5 ranged between 4 to 81. A high Pearson's (r) statistical correlation occurred between JIF and SJR indicators for journals in this category (r = 0.892) and between JIF and H5 indices (r = 0.769), while it is rather moderate between JIF and ES values (r = 0.690). Spearsman's rho statistical correlation indicated an acceptable and identical correlation appeared between JIF and SJR indicators, JIF and ES rankings and between JIF and H5 for journals in Sports science (coefficient value = 0.905, 0.845 and 0.818, respectively).",

They misuse the open access publishing model and charge huge publication fees/Article Processing Charges to publish scientific papers without any peer review/little peer-review. These hoax publishing have been spamming authors mainly with emails, inviting them to submit research papers for publication. The wide spread of these journals are negatively affecting on the ethics of the admissible journals, the reputations of authors, academic organisations & research institutions, and even the researchers and students. This situation is very critical towards online open access publishing and how to stop these publishing is a big challenge for academic researcher. The reason behind the problems is not the publishers alone; some researchers are also to blame for creating such types of challenges. Authors should avoid this publishing firm to respect the real science and real research. This paper highlights an overview of predatory publishing, some predatory frequently used terms, reason behind these publishing and what are the precautions followed to controlling this type of fraud are the basic of the study.",

The personal characteristics that affect the users’ choices of criteria to evaluate the quality of blogs are examined as well. Keeping the objectives into consideration, to acquire users’ criteria for assessing the quality of blogs, the questionnaire was used as the instrument of the study. Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, an independent t-test, and a one-way ANOVA were employed to analyze data from the user survey. From an extensive literature review on the quality of information resources a list of common quality indicators was compiled. The collected quality criteria and indicators were transformed into hypothesized frameworks not tailored to any specific domain or demography. In order to gain better insight on the evaluation of blog quality and to identify the criteria that people consider crucial when evaluating the quality of blogs, online and face-to-face survey to rate the importance of indicators on a five point scale ranging from 1 (not important to all) to 5 (extremely important) was used. The sample included Banaras Hindu University faculty and staff members. The study's findings include 1) the criteria that users consider important when evaluating the quality of blogs are content quality, usability, authority, and blog credibility; 2) the indicators that blog users consider most important for evaluating the quality of blogs are understandability, accuracy, believability, currency, ease of use, and navigation; and 3) gender, education level, age, profession, purpose of use, and specific interests affect the user's choices of criteria for evaluating the quality of blogs.The study proposes various factors that users consider important while evaluating blogs. It also proposes a user-centered framework for evaluating the quality of blogs. Bloggers can give their concern on these factors to make their blogs popular among users.",

It can be achieved in an environment of complete freedom-freedom of mind, freedom of heart and freedom of will.

Tagore believed education divorced from the stream of life and confined within the four walls of the classroom becomes artificial and loses its value. The present paper is an attempt to understand Tagore's concept of knowledge and methods he adopted to communicate it for societal development. It is observed that Tagore tried to give concrete shape of his ideas with the establishment of twin institutions at Santiniketan and Sriniketan for knowledge generation as well as dissemination.

            "abstract": "Web 2.0 applications play a vital role to establish two way communications with the help of networking system to create and share online information or materials. The study was based on survey using questionnaire method with the objective to investigate library science population and familiarity of concepts towards the Web 2.0 tools, to identify the common understanding and attitudes of library science population towards the Web 2.0 tools and technologies, to identify the barriers to the use of web 2.0 applications, to identify the library science professionals’ and library science students’ learning mode of Web 2.0 and its usage and adoption. Data were collected from two populations: library science professionals at TUCL and library science students of T.U. The majority of the respondents were female (60%), age group from 21–30 (52%), master degree holders (56%) and from library science students (60%). The study revealed that respondents had general level of understanding and usage of Web 2.0 tools in their field. The respondents (100%) agreed that the applications of Web 2.0 tools were helpful to develop their self-efficacy and provide interactive library services. Study has attempted to find the changing trend of usage of Web 2.0 tools of the library science populations. According to the findings, most of the library science populations define the Web 2.0 tools according to their need and capabilities. Most of them (88%) think that Web 2.0 tools are social networking tools. In these senses, the general concepts and perceptions towards Web 2.0 tools are very low. It also found that the majority didn't use some of the interactive Web 2.0 tools and services. Usage of web 2.0 tools between library science professionals and students were found some how different. Lack of the know-how and technical knowledge could be another reason for the low use of Web 2.0 tools and services in the library science fields. Some recommendations were highlighted to make maximum and beneficial use of web 2.0 applications among library science professionals.",

The survey method has been adopted as the method to conduct the study and questionnaire has been used as a main data collection tool for collection of data. The telephonic interaction and e-mail correspondence has also been used to seek clarifications, remove ambiguities and obtain data of higher significance. It is found that presently major chunk of the allocated budget is being spent on acquisition of print form of books and journals across all the seven libraries under scope of present study. As such the advent of e-books and e-journals seems to have not yet laid any prominent impact on budget appropriation. Though the libraries seem to have switched their focus towards e-journals than that of print, they are seen to avail their full text access through consortium subscribed platforms and do not afford to buy many e-journals of their own. The interest to subscribe bibliographical of abstract level databases, seems to have diminished across the libraries under study. Though the libraries are interested to procure good number and quality e-books the budgetary provisions do not support or allow them to fulfill this instinct. This is first work of its nature in northern India with domain as agricultural libraries. The findings will help the librarians and the financial authorities to make judicious allocation of budget and allow them to utilise it well in commensuration with the actual need.",

Introducing green culture into library certainly helps in reducing unnecessary waste and conservation of natural resources. Green technology practices and culture involve implementation of environmentally supportive and sustainable activities like construction of green library building, greening existing library facilities and services within the library. Accordingly, with all such greening practices libraries can act as a key factor in the environmental and sustainability movement. This paper gives examples dealing with the ideas of how to go green in the library.",

It aimed to examine the searching capabilities on searching online databases and to know students’ knowledge on organizing the information that students had retrieved. Here a practical study was conducted to investigate skills on information literacy among post-graduate students. Out of 23 students and faculty members, 13 students of Environment Science at Khwopa College, Bhaktapur were taken for this study purpose. They were asked pre-test and post-test questions. After having their pre-test response, a two days training was conducted on online database searching and Mendeley reference management software was taught. These two topics were taught within one week difference, so that students’ get time for practice. Soon after training, the students were made to fill post-test questionnaire. Data was collected from the answer sheets of these participants. All 13 students filled the questionnaire. From the data analysis, it was derived that t-test for paired samples between result of pre-test and post-test (p = 0.02) supported students obtained good knowledge on information literacy and use in their work after the information literacy training. They understood better about information sources (by 100%) and made improvement in information searching. Moreover they learnt the organization and management of information sources. However the study showed students got difficulties in exploiting search strategy tool; hence need further training for them on search strategy. College library must provide better information services that support information literacy for college students.",

            "abstract": "Reading habit among teacher trainees is very essential as it not only improves their own knowledge base but also indirectly influences the students whom they are about to teach. Poor reading habit leads to low quality of education in students. A survey was conducted among 191 B. Ed students under nine optional subjects. The findings prove that B. Ed students like reading and majority of them spend 1–2 hour daily for reading. But the influence of electronic medias like TV, Computer, Internet etc have reduced the time they spend for reading.",

            "abstract": "This study takes a cursory look at prison inmates’ utilisation of library media resources in preparation for Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination in Nigeria from 2009 to 2013. Three of the prisons that prepare and register inmates for these Examinations were randomly selected for the study. These are Abakaliki prisons in the South-East, Ikoyi prisons in South-West and Kuje prisons in North-Central Nigeria. A total of five hundred questionnaires were administered on the inmates registered for SSSCE in the various prisons sampled, namely: Abakaliki 160 inmates with a response rate of 142, Ikoyi 240 inmates with a response rate of 209 and Kuje 100 inmates with a response rate of 87. However, 438 questionnaires were duly completed and returned, and found useable for the study, representing a response rate of 87.6%. The study revealed that 353 inmates(80.6%) utilise photocopying services, 322 inmates(73.5%) utilise journals, 311 inmates(71.0%) utilise Book loan services, 237 inmates (54.1%) utilise past examination questions, 211 inmates(50.5%) utilise West African Examinations Council curricula and syllabi, while 320 inmates(73.1%) claimed that staff attitude was not a hindrance to their utilisation of the library resources. Also, 79.0% claimed that weekend opening was not a challenge to their utilisation of library media resources, 83.6% do not see non-book loan as a challenge and 90.4% equally do not see library opening hours as a hindrance. However, 268 inmates (61.2%) claimed that they do not utilise the general reading materials and 312 inmates(71.2%) do not utilise the prescribed (recommended) textbooks. Recommendations were made accordingly as deduced from the findings.",

For the study questionnaire based survey method was used that was structured using the 4 point likert scale. From an exhaustive literature review six criteria: user education, information resource availability, attitude of the library staffs, library working hours and disciplinary as well as security measures were taken for the study. Average mean of 2.50 was used as a cut-off point for the study. Out of the six factors under study: user education, information resource availability, attitude of the library staffs, library working hours, disciplinary as well as security measures five factors are strong determinant for the adherence to library rules and regulations. Over a period of time impact of library rules and regulations over the users have remained a neglected topic. The present study is an attempt to fill the void and find out the factors that are responsible for the adherence of library rules and regulations in a university library. Based on the findings suggestions have been proposed which could be taken into concern for strong adherence among students of the library rules and regulations.",

The present paper gives a case study of the WebOPAC of Rabindra Library-Central Library of Assam University. The customization done at the Assam University is totally need based and still complete features and options are not utilized to make it more attractive, however, modification of the WebOPAC is a continuous process and after using more options, the WebOPAC will be made more beautiful and interactive.

Paintal's first paper was published in1952 at the age of 26. The period 1971–1980, when Paintal was 46–55 years old, was his most productive period (3 papers per year). In the byline of authors his status ranged from first author to sixth author. Paintal's research team comprised 28 collaborators. Asima Anand was the most productive collaborator of the scientist. Most of his papers were published in international journals, and Journal of Physiology (London) was the most preferred journal. Finally, it is seen that the data set does not follow Bradford Law.",

The study found that all the research scholars are using library e-resources specifically for research work and e-journals (83%) are most used resources. However, majority of them use e-resources and printed material equally and need training regarding information retrieval and discipline specific search. CeRA (Consortium for e-Resources in Agriculture) and KrishiPrabha e-Theses, DOAJ, Agricola, sources on educational and bibliographical information and encyclopaedias are most used e-resources by the research scholars. Slow access speed in reaching the needed e-resource and difficulty in downloading are the major problems in accessing the e-resources. This study offers the suggestions for further improvement of access of electronic resources to fulfil the research needs of scholars.",

As a part of support services provided by distance learning institutions libraries play an important role in dissemination of information resources to distance learners.

So the present study attempts to know the perception of IGNOU graduate and postgraduate students regarding library services. The study also analyses the frequency of visiting the library by the learners and satisfaction derived from the various services at IGNOU libraries. The study revealed that students lack awareness about the library services, prefer to purchase help-books rather than consulting reference books and most students do not prefer to visit the library at all.",

E-resources such as e-books, e-journals and databases have become preferred choice of users due to their characteristic features. It has become important to understand their structural functionalities in order to exploit them to the fullest. E-resources are required to be embedded with linking tools such as Cross Ref; DOI, DOI-X, Open URL and Link Resolver for maximum outreach and usability. The scholarly content are further disseminated through range of access technology such as Generic password, IP Access, Proxy Server, Virtual Private Network, Athens and Shibboleth Authentication to make them more accessible any time anywhere. Cloud computing based IT infrastructure is yet another promising proposition for libraries delivering services at cost effective operational models with reduced complexity.

This paper aims to present the results of a survey research that investigated post-graduate students at Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India. This survey research is done through a quantitative approach by using the questionnaire as a tool for data collection. The researchers designed the questionnaire with open-ended and closeended questions and distributed to post-graduate students. The data analysis revealed that major purpose to use the web tools by the students is for professional activities like finding relevant materials, sharing with friends and promoting their research. This is positive sign that students are focused and use the Web 2.0 tools for educational purpose. Students feel that privacy is the major concern for them. This study is limited to examine the students’ usage and experiences of Web 2.0 tools by small group of post-graduate students of TISS, Mumbai. Therefore, the results should not be generalized in different settings to describe all students’ experiences of the use of Web 2.0 tools. This research study gives a clear picture of students and their use of web 2.0 tools in their education. This research can be helpful to the fraternities so as to help students understand the importance of these tools. Their awareness level about the tools can be observed and can be improved.",

PIM refers to a set of activities a person performs in order to acquire, create, store, organize, maintain, retrieve, use and distribute personal information for different purposes. The study is based on a questionnaire survey of research scholars of the six departments under the Faculty of Applied Science at University of Kerala. A structured questionnaire was designed for the data collection on the basis of objectives of the study. Questionnaire consists of both optional type questions and statements in five point Lickert scale. The study includes the full time research scholars under the Faculty of Applied Science at University of Kerala. Out of the 59 respondents, 69.60% females and 30.40% male scholars are using their lap tops for managing personal information. The study attempts to identify various factors such as age, gender and qualification of the research scholars. Majority of the respondents agreed that they know more about managing their personal information and apply it on research work and it helps to present papers. The study revealed that 49.15% research scholars agreed that PIM helps them to present papers and motivate research work.The findings of the study indicate that the respondents find difficulties in updating. Analysis also showed that most of the research scholars have above average skills on information searching and maintenance. The paper highlights the attitude of research scholars towards personal information management.",

            "abstract": "Health literacy is a person's ability to access, understand, communicate and apply health-related information wisely. Social media service platforms are gaining popularity in connecting, informing, educating and disseminating information to online communities on varied aspects. In health care sector, the WHO, NLM, NHS and various other organizations are providing information globally to people on health and safety issues, health education programmes, etc. through social networks like Facebook and YouTube. This paper reviews relevant literature available on the Google Scholar and the PubMed database on Health Literacy and Social Networks. It also surveys the websites of top ten medical institutions of the world and top ten medical colleges of India to find out their acceptance of social media tools. It is observed that in India social media tools and their adoption by medical colleges have not been exploited much in comparison with the top ten medical institutions of the world and our literature on health literacy is scanty. Considering India's large population, low health literacy, woeful shortage of doctors in rural areas, language and communication barriers, and so on it is suggested that the medical institutions must incorporate social media tools on their websites and promote health literacy-based education. This will connect health professionals with communities and thereby promote health literacy. The need for well-designed social network policies at every medical institution and creation of guides, tutorials and mobile applications has been stressed. These will help people to understand health terminologies and concepts as well as causes, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases in general. Risks associated with the health information quality on social networks have also been addressed.",

A sample of two hundred questionnaires was administered on the freshmen across the four Faculties of the University namely: Agriculture, Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences and Science, with a response rate of 197, representing 98.5%. The findings revealed that orientation was educative, enlightening and interactive and it allowed for question and answer opportunity. The results further showed that direct contact and familiarity with the Principal Officers of the university is ensured while accommodation and other challenges of freshmen are addressed. Orientation programme/tours equally allow for the familiarity of freshmen with the institution. As to whether orientation was a waste of time, 193 respondents (96.5%) disagreed while 4 respondents (2%) agreed. Likewise, on whether orientation should be cancelled, 195 respondents (97.5%) said no while only 2 respondents (1%) said yes. In like manner, 192 respondents (96%) claimed that orientation talks/speeches motivate and encourage freshmen but 5 respondents (2.5%) disagreed. However, 193 respondents (96.5%) opined that orientation should be held consistently annually for freshmen while 4 respondents (2%) were against this opinion/option. Recommendations were made as appropriate in line with the findings to enhance and sustain orientation programme in tertiary institutions in Nigeria.",

Knowing the environmental conditions in a library/archive is essential for planning the best strategy for the preservation of collections effectively. In order to control temperature and relative humidity at a fixed level, these should be measured and recorded systematically. The present study deals with the objectives of finding out the month-wise average temperature (both maximum and minimum) and relative humidity, all time record of temperature and relative humidity of the area under study, month-wise average sunlight hours of the area under study for the last ten years (2005–2014). Gives an outline about the reasons of deterioration of library collection, and proposes curative measures of the library collection anywhere in tropical areas, with special reference to Sriniketan, Birbhum district of West Bengal. Discusses some major guidelines for regulating environmental conditions in preserving library collection. The study is based on the ten years data collected from the Meteorological Department, Sriniketan, West Bengal. Annual Reports of Visva-Bharati have been used for collecting data like library collection, year of establishment, area of library. From the data analysis it was found that maximum temperature was 45.9ºC on April 04, 2010 and minimum was 4.9OC on January 01, 2013. Relative humidity remains 58 to 85 in Sriniketan. During the period of study average lowest humidity was 58.15% in March and average highest humidity was 85.54% in September. A maximum sunlight hour was 11.2 hours on August 09, 2007. Findings of the study may help the authority of libraries of Visva-Bharati Library Network as well as respective Bhavan Administration to adopt the appropriate measures towards controlling temperature, relative humidity, etc. to protect their valuable library collection.",

IRs are becoming prevalent in the academic sector with the rapid changes in technology, scholarly practices and patron expectations. Academic institutions are grappling to create functional IRs to facilitate the growth in teaching, learning and research. UGC (2005) in India has already developed a policy document on building Digital Repositories at University Level. National Knowledge Commission (2007) strongly advocated archiving research literature for building nation wide Institutional Repository. This paper tries to explore the actual scenario of Institutional Repositories in different R&D libraries of Kolkata and surrounding areas.",

For the development of a digital library, the information bearing objects are available freely from the publicly indexable World Wide Web by utilizing freeware like Apache as web server, PERL packages and modules and GSDL as digital library software. Paper also traces out the application of Dublin Core Metadata Elements Set (DCMES) for resource description and resource discovery in distributed information environment. Libraries of all kinds may follow the procedures as suggested in the study along with the software and they can easily and simply develop their digital library in a cost effective manner. The study may be extended to design value added e-Info services accessible through web and as datasets on CD ROM and it is as good as demonstration of entire steps of digital library development.",

A survey was conducted through a structured questionnaire circulated among 250 library users taken from different categories and the response rate was 96 per cent. Stratified accidental random sample method was used for selection of respondents and interacting with them. The study revealed that students browse Internet for social, academic and professional purposes. All the researchers and teachers are using search engines for the retrieval of scholarly information for research purposes. Google is the most widely used search engine followed by yahoo and scirus. Majority of the students and teachers use search engines mainly for their study purposes and most of the research scholars use them for their research work. Most of the respondents are using search strategies and majority of them preferred field searching methods. Retrieval of too much unwanted information is the major hindrance faced while using search engines. The study highlights the practicality of the awareness and use of search engines for the retrieval of scholarly information and it will assist the policy makers, planners and the librarians to understand the user's awareness of the search engines and their use in the academic study and research.",

It also has impact on reference services as electronic reference services for substantial implication for libraries. These implications keep very close to the history and mission of libraries. Reference services are receiving primary attention as librarians strategically position themselves to serve users who are entering in the library through both ways- physical and through electronic gateway. In present virtual era, libraries actively try to design, implement and market alternative reference services to meet users’ needs and retain their identity in present digital world. Now a days, many libraries are using different Library 2.0 tools (like RSS feeds, social networking sites, blogs etc.) to provide library services to the users. The paper deals with the use of Blogs in libraries to provide electronic reference services.",

Information retrieval and critical appraisal of information have become important because medical education standards require medical students and residents to possess those skills. The present study is an attempt to know the information literacy skills of the Faculty and Students of Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak. The study was based on the data collected through questionnaires. The collected data was analyzed using MS-Excel. It was found that all the respondents were able to specify their information needs and were aware of the different kinds of information sources and online databases. It was found that faculty members were more able to make use of the retrieved information than the students. A significant number of respondents overestimated their skills by rating themselves very high and high in accessing information in electronic format while they were unfamiliar with basic search technique used for searching information in an online database. It was recommended that users’ need oriented Information Literacy Programmes should be organized regularly. For the effective conduction of information literacy programme, more collaboration of medical library professionals with the faculty and students was recommended. Beside this, it was also suggested that information literacy may be added as a subject in the health science curriculum so as to make the medical professionals information literate.",

It is, therefore, suggested that there should be some check on the usage of these resources, so that valuable time of the coffee planters should not get wasted. Instead they may devote more time on reading to enhance their knowledge base in their age of competition. Majority of the coffee planters opined that reading habits can improve through the talk of eminent personalities/guest lectures and the encouragement by family members and through orientation programmes conducted by library professionals.",

Essential features of the Public Library Services have been comprehensively covered. It talks about Modern Public Library System in India and the role that Ranganathan played in its implementation throughout the country starting with the Tamil Nadu state in 1948. The lecture summarizes different scenarios of the public library system in India including State level status, status in the Union Territories, status in the National Capital Region, status in the early period, during Pre-Independence period and present scenario. Prominent privately/municipal corporation funded public libraries have been covered in the chronological order including Marwari Public Library, Hardayal Municipal Public Library, Fatehpuri Muslim Public Library, Ramkrishna Mission Library, centrally funded Delhi Public Library, etc. The author further covers in his lecture the NCT of Delhi Public Library Development Plan, and presents the Public Library Model and emphasizes the need for adoption of a Public Library Legislation with the help of Central Government and discusses its implementation strategy and other aspects. The author strongly suggests the need to implement the proposed development plan through Delhi Public Library System as it has fairly a good networked libraries in the NCT of Delhi. The need to conduct surveys to understand the user population for their reading interests, collections, services, etc. has been discussed to help to effectively implement the public library system. In order to meet the needs of the users effectively, it is necessary that each unit of a public library should be a viable unit and should function as integral part of the locality in a decentralized manner at local level. The author further talks about the role of National Mission on Libraries (NML) for the promotion and development of public library services at different levels in the country. While concluding, the author expressed sincere desire that the DLA should take up necessary steps and formulate an action plan so as to spread the message about the need for a proper public library system in the NCT of Delhi.",

The statistical population included all the female students at the state secondary schools of Alborz Province. Among the four educational areas, the schools in the third and fourth areas were randomly selected as the sample.The findings indicated that all the schools under the study had library and more than half of the students (53.69%) were members of either the school library or the other public libraries all over the city. It was found that personal interest in book and reading were the main impetus for their reading and going to the library. It was also found that first parents, then peers, teachers, library staff and finally the school principals were the main incentives for the students’ reading. The findings demonstrated that numerous pieces of homework act as the main barrier for the development of reading culture among the students. The best solution in order to enhance the reading level might be denoting books and introducing them in the mass media.Results show that the reading status among state secondary school students in Alborz Province is rather undesirable. In this regard, both parents and educational system are required to play a more active role and take more serious actions in order to enhance the reading level among the students as the future planners of our country.",

University Grants Commission, a national apex body responsible for planning, policy making and maintenance of standards in higher education in India has taken a number of measures including introduction of choice based credit system in the university. This system will provide ample opportunities to make a choice from array of subjects offered by the same department and other departments in the campus. The present paper discusses the introduction of choice based credit system in library and information science keeping in view the international trends and developments with regards to its recognition, credit transfer and quality assurance. The paper further discusses the credits, courses and components of Master's course in Library and Information Science based on choice based credit system and introduced in Mizoram University, located in the north-eastern part of India. The authors conclude that the effective implementation of the course depends on proper counselling to the students opting for soft courses and open electives and monitoring at regular interval. The ultimate objective of this system is to bring quality at par with international standard in which the pass out students not only enhance their subject knowledge and learning skills but get international recognition as well.",

Informs that library associations have rarely been made the subject of study and research. Preparing libraries and library workers is a challenging task for library associations in the new techno-savvy and user oriented environment. Opines that Queen's Batten was left unguarded since 1970s (Ranganathan died in 1972). Under the influence of pseudo Librarians/LIS Teachers, the profession as a whole and the Institutions of national/international importance, have lost their sheen. Makes a brief note on the work done by early library associations in India. Enlists certain common missions/mottos/objectives of library associations. Demands from the profession to honour the maxim SANGHE SHAKTI KALIYUGE. Draws support form the story of “kabootar and bahelia’ from old classic Panchtantra. Discusses the strengths and achievements of DLA. Predicts the future image of library associations and librarianship and emphasizes on the need to develop, expand and enhance professional competency and the status of library workers. Highlights some observations and provides some suggestions, such as, visualization of concept of ‘Chartered Librarians’ as a new vista for librarianship, and ‘SLISS’ for school libraries. Recommends to responsible office bearers of the associations to ‘introspect’ with objectivity like viewing a mirror. Provides Appendix-1 (Anecdotes from life and career of Prof. P.N.Kaula,and Appendix-2 (List of some select library associations in India and other countries).",

Due to this, libraries instead of depending totally on their own resources have started accessing networks or consortia for utilization of wide range of resources available therein at divided cost. With the ongoing developments, we are in a phase where new technologies such as Cloud Computing are coming and becoming popular to strives and democratize computing power. With this background, the lecture focuses on suitability of cloud computing in libraries and how Cloud Computing based services can be used by libraries. India is becoming economically self sufficient with adequate technology and skills to adopt this technology to enable libraries to offer innovative services by maintaining better control over the applications and data centres. In this competitive environment, libraries are required to focus and avail the advantages of cloud computing to offer user-centered multi-level services to enable them to become self supportive in seeking their information with greater level of confidence as well as satisfaction.",

A survey resaearch design was adopted for the study and the 92 staff of the ten selected special libraries were given copies of the structured questionnaires to elicit necessary information. Out of these, 81 returned with valid responses and found useable. This represents 88% response rate. Tables, simple percentage and frequency count were used to analyse the results. Among others, the findings showed that seminars/workshops are the most widely used HCB programmes. Recommendations capable of improving the HCB in special libraries were offered.",

The paper presents the current status of selection committee for recruiting senior library positions in public institutions of the country. The interaction with the selection committee is of utmost importance for a professional aspiring for higher positions and thus no effort must be spared for the process to be objective, transparent and purposive. The paper discusses the latest UGC regulations for both direct recruitment and career advancement promotion regarding library positions. It also underlines some of the possible limitations in the existing system such as procedural anomalies, lack of inventories maintained, adopting a limited pool of experts, resorting to illogical and inconvenienced application procedures, cancelling advertisements, releasing corrigendum notices, cancelling interviews and increased dependence on the personal interview. Stresses empowering the candidates through refinements such as suitably acknowledging the receipt of applications received, intimating candidates not shortlisted citing reasons, affirmative action for special classes to guarantee equal opportunity for applicants, eliminating subjectivity in interview process, opting for a cordial rather than charged up interview technique, collecting feedback about interviewers from the interviewees, recording and documenting the personal interview of each candidate, regret letters to non-selected candidates with creative feedback of the selection committee, and rigorous measures and tools in effective staff selection could be better achieved through a comprehensive national level process in the event of non conformance and dilution at the institution level.",

Ninety eight (98) copies of the questionnaires were completed, returned and used for this study, which represents (65.3% percent) response rate. The findings revealed that nearly all the doctors have access to the Internet, know how to use it and it affords them the opportunity of applying ideas gained from the use of Internet-based information to improve their work activities. The findings also reported inadequate infrastructure to support Internet information resources utilization. The study therefore recommended that hospital management should endeaviour to overhaul their infrastructural facilities as this will motivate doctors to utilize bulks of knowledge emanating from the Internet.",

The main objectives of the study are to make an in-depth analysis of the resources, organizational pattern, information services and products with respect to each teaching school and to provide suggestions for the establishment of teaching school libraries in the University of Kerala. The data for the study are collected from the department librarians through interview supported by a well structured interview schedule. The analysis is done by grouping the department libraries under the proposed 11 schools using tabular arrangement and statistical techniques. The study found that each department library has sound collection and resources with different organizational systems managed by well qualified library professionals. The study proposed a uniform system of organization and automation for the department libraries for the establishment of one central library for each school working in two shifts by pooling the resources of the concerned department libraries.",

These publications appeared as journal articles (1039), conference papers (360), book chapters (171) and books (40). Of the 1039 journal articles, 62% were published in Indian journals and 38% in foreign journals. Among the foreign journals, scientists preferred to publish in journals originated from USA, The Netherlands and UK. The analysis indicates that maximum number of articles were published in the Indian Journal of Animal Sciences (16%) followed by Indian Veterinary Journal (12%). The major research focus is on agriculture breeding and genetics followed by animal disease and pathology, animal physiology, and animal health and nutrition. The authorship pattern revealed that collaborative research contribution accounted for 1543 papers indicating a tendency among authors to work in teams. The analysis also indicates that IVRI (Indian Veterinary Research Institute), CIRG (Central Institute for Research on Goats) and NDRI (National Dairy Research Institute) with 351, 230 and 202 contributions respectively are the most productive institutions among the ICAR system in the discipline of animal science. The study also tests the applicability of Lotka's law of author productivity and Bradford's law of scattering.",

Research on Reading Habits shows that love of reading is more important for children's educational success. With the advancements of science and technology, reading habits are clearly diminishing. The students are more and more influenced by movies, internet, and slimy television soaps that affect them in different spheres of their growth and development. The investigation aimed to explore various aspects that influence reading habits of school going girls in a city area, Calicut in Kerala. A survey was conducted using a questionnaire having 21 items on a sample of 702 school going girls. The data was analysed using tables, figures, and percentages. The investigation found out that majority of girls in the sample like reading, and about half of them spent about an hour or more for reading daily.",

The present paper deals with the existing patterns of acquisition and collection, its organization, management and retrieval of information resources preserved in the library. The information is usually stored, but more important is to organize the collection in such a way that any information can be retrieved instantly. The required data is collected by the library staff. Here the case study of ‘Samyuktha Karnataka’ a popular daily Kannada Language newspaper library has been undertaken.",

While discussing the scholarly communication process in the context of journal publishing, it identifies four challenges: Peer-review, Journal Impact Factor, Cost of Journals, and Perpetual Access to Digital Publications. In order to make a case of reconsidering the current scholarly communication practices due to recent developments in information and communication technologies, the paper recommends adoption of Open Access to scientific information and research, open peer review, Open Educational Resources, and Social Media in the scholarly communication process. It concludes that reconsidering practices in scholarly communication will not only increase access to scholarly information, but also increase communication amongst scholars and potential scholars (students), and increase the possibility of achieving universal access to quality and relevant information at the right time.",

Factors such as lack of education, mental and physical disabilities, and professionals’ ignorance prevent them from observing the ergonomic principles. This study aims at investigating the ergonomic conditions for librarians in libraries of the University of Isfahan and the relationship of these conditions with demographic factors, to achieve maximum efficiency. The checklist of ergonomic standards and principles was delivered to all library staff of the University of Isfahan (61 persons) in 2010. The results showed that librarians of the University are not working in good ergonomic conditions. Based on the findings, there is a relationship between gender and health factors and infringe benefits; years in service and health factors; and organizational rank and the work place, equipments, health factors, personal safety tools, and infringe benefits, whereas no relationship was found between ergonomic conditions and educational level, academic major and age. The study provides valuable results concerning ergonomic conditions in libraries of University of Isfahan and their relationship with demographic factors. It is proposed that managers and especially librarians should observe the ergonomic principles in libraries, as the academic libraries are information centres which play an important role in development and growth of societies.",

The study implemented a descriptive analytical method. The study tool was a researcher design questionnaire. All M.A. students in Faculty of Education and Psychology were selected as statistical population for the study (n=145). The results showed that the students’ ILC mean for recognizing their information need was 3.65, for bridging previous knowledge with the current obtained information 3.39, for being acquainted with information resources and databases 2.7, for information search strategy 3.05, for information retrieving 2.87, for information evaluation and assessing 3.02, for organizing information 2.97, and finally for managing citations 3.06.The research reported studied students’ ILC status as 3.22 which is higher than the average. Overall, the ILC status is reasonable and it seems that students could handle their scientific needs. Nonetheless, the studied students are far beyond the optimum status desired by the university authorities.",

The present article aims to introduce the basics of EBL, summarizes the steps involved, and presents the implications for the Library and Information Science profession in India. The EBL process involves specifying the problem, finding the evidence to answer the problem, appraising the evidence, applying the results, evaluating the outcome and, if necessary, redefining the problem. One begins the process by identifying and clarifying what exactly one is aiming to do, for which EBL can be applied. The next step is to search for the evidence and examine it critically followed by applying the evidence that has been collected and evaluated. It is practical to prepare an Action Plan at the outset. An important part of this stage is also to evaluate the effect of applying evidence-based practice in the given situation. Therefore, the evaluation process must be planned as part of evidence based practice, before implementing the evidence-based decision. It is suggested that Indian librarians should integrate EBL into their professional practice. In the initial stages, at the practical level, the following initiatives should be considered: Library and information professionals should carry out more action research; initiatives should be taken by apex bodies such as Library Associations, University Departments of Library & Information Science, the National Library and other similar institutions to develop systems for sharing of evidence; and a culture of evidence based practice should be promoted across the L&IS profession.",

As a result, the graduates from the LIS departments have little competitive potential in the information market. The paper discusses the challenges in LIS education in the Indian context. It deals with preparing LIS graduates for leadership and management roles to support national and economic development in India, as well as the collaboration and resource sharing among LIS schools.

            "abstract": "In a knowledge economy, the significance of knowledge and education is universally acknowledged. Economic competitiveness and prosperity of a country depends upon the strides made in the field of Education and Training. The conventional system of education is not able to cope with the increased demand for training, education and updating knowledge. Distance learning has emerged as a viable option for lifelong learning and as a means for human resource development in the country. It is acquisition of knowledge and skills through mediated information and instruction. It covers all technologies and facilitates the pursuit of lifelong learning for all. This massive popularity in distance education has eventually resulted in the libraries attaining an enormous importance; their role in the effective delivery of distance education has increased manifold. The paper presents the prevailing status of library operations in different open universities of the country. It discusses how Information Communication technologies should be harnessed by libraries to supplement and complement distance education in the country. The paper further endeavours to compare them with library practices adopted at other open Universities (such as Hong Kong Open University, Athabasca Open University of Canada, Open University of United Kingdom), Sheffield Hallam University, UK, and Jones International University, USA. which have emerged as pioneers in library and information intrinsic delivery of distance education. The paper suggests an equitable access model, which may be adopted by open Universities’ libraries across the country for providing effective distance education in the country.",

In the age of information explosion, it has created a new demand for proficiencies and capabilities to deal with information. The aim of this study is to assess the information literacy competency of ISLM graduate students and also focus on the strengths and weaknesses of students. In general it was found that students had limited skills in the area of information literacy as most of the IL courses were not available in their syllabus. Based on these findings, a series of recommendations were proposed to help develop information literacy competency. This study urges that incorporation of information literacy programme in the course curriculum, more and more writings, discussion and other relevant issues will make ISLM graduate students more information literate.",

            "abstract": "Even after 63 years of independence the condition of primary school libraries in the country remains highly neglected. Primary schools in city suburbs and rural areas are running without any libraries. The situation of primary school libraries in Uttar Pradesh is among the worst in the country. There is no consistency in the growth and development of primary school libraries in Uttar Pradesh. This shows that the State Education Department has not given due importance and priority to the development of libraries at primary school level. The study emphasizes the role of libraries in primary school education and highlights the problems faced by school libraries. The study highlights the recommendations and/or suggestions contained in reports of different Committees, Commissions, Working Groups, Seminars in this regard, particularly in primary school libraries. This study investigates existing state of primary school libraries in Uttar Pradesh with reference to District Azamgarh by using the questionnaire method and finds out the existing state of collection, analyses problems using tables, and finally ends with valuable suggestions. The study shows that proper library policy, book selection methods and library hours are not followed in primary schools selected for the study. In primary schools, usually some teachers are entrusted with the additional duties of a librarian. Under these circumstances, almost all the primary school libraries fail to develop good reading habits among children. The study concludes that the purpose of primary school libraries is identical with the purpose of the primary school education, and this realization needs yet to be understood in our country.",

The study investigates the suitability of the facilities and status of the Iranian academic library buildings. Therefore, based on the available standards, the Iranian academic library building facilities were examined through five-point evaluative criteria. Every criterion consisted of some sub-criteria, in which a total of 33 subcriteria were identified for evaluation of academic library building facilities. The study population was all academic universities in Tehran, in which 7 state universities were sampled randomly. Every criterion had unique sub-criteria, thus for each criterion a specific score was assigned, for example, the interior design condition criterion had 13 sub-criteria, therefore it had 13 scores. Other criteria had 4,9,3 and 4 sub-criteria, respectively. All library buildings were evaluated based on the total scores they gained of the total criteria. According to the study, library buildings of the University of Tehran and Tarbiat Moallem University had the best and the worst status respectively.",

            "abstract": "The concept of Library 2.0 is borrowed from that of Web 2.0 and Business 2.0 and follows some of the same underlying philosophies. Library 2.0 encompasses a range of new and contemporary technological tools and techniques that are used for evolving collaborative environment required for Library 2.0. These tools and techniques can broadly be grouped into five categories, i.e. i) Synchronous Communication: Instant messaging; ii) Content Delivery: RSS Feed, HTML Feed, Streaming Media, Podcasting, Vodcasting and SMS Enquiry Services; iii) Collaborative Publishing Tools: Blogs and Wikis; iv) Collaborative Service Platforms: Social Networks, Tagging, Social Bookmarking Services; and v) Hybrid Applications, Programmes and Programming Tools: Mashups, AJAX, API and Toolbar. These tools and techniques are useful for libraries in providing new services and making existing services available in new and interesting ways. Implementation of some of these tools and techniques are likely to improve reputation and standing of libraries in the community. Some of them may successfully attract new patrons to the library, others may help to retain existing members or make libraries even more important as centres of the culture and history of their cities and academic institutions. Some of the new services may remain unused. However, since feedback and public opinion is a vital component of Library 2.0, such services may be abandoned in favour of other services that are better accepted by the users. Some of those changes may be viewed as disruptive, while others may not be feasible or applicable to all libraries. These new services and ongoing changes are likely to make libraries more interesting, more relevant, and better acceptable place.Applications of Library 2.0 has promise to bring revolutionary changes in libraries that are bound to bring about conceptual, cultural and physical changes in libraries to keep pace with the changes in communities and their information seeking behaviour. Applications of Web 2.0 technologies in libraries will result in a meaningful and substantive change in libraries, its collection, services and methods of delivery of services. The library's collection will change, becoming more interactive and fully accessible. The library's services will change, focusing more on the facilitation of information transfer and information literacy rather than providing controlled access to it. The implications of these revolutionary technologies are enormous and are discussed in the paper along with their examples as applied in the INFLIBNET Centre.",

Questionnaire method was used to obtain data in the five (5) schools in the college. Out of 550 copies of questionnaires sent out to students, 540 were returned giving a response rate of 98% and 100% for librarians. The result showed that professional librarian give adequate instructions to users despite limited facilities.Of the user survey on the library use course and its relevance to their course of study showed that student have adequate knowledge of use of library; and the use of OPAC and CD-ROM facilities improved their reading habit, but are lacking in the area of internet use. This indicates that the use of the library as a course has positive and meaningful impacts on the students. The study recommends networking the operational system of the library with online services and internet connectivity in order to enhancing teaching of the library use course.",

The questionnaire survey method used in the study reveals that informal channels are more frequently used for information gathering. Books are used more than other types of information resources, both by teachers and students. Journals are preferred for formal source of information while preparing course/teaching materials. The study focuses on how teachers and students utilize the various resources available in the library for enabling the teaching learning process. The findings of the survey are summarized and implications for libraries are discussed.",

Citation analysis is discussed particularly as a means of assisting researchers in clarifying formal communication patterns among papers of Library Herald, a quarterly journal of Delhi Library Association. As a means of studying formal communication processes, Library and Information Science researchers have used journal citation analysis in a number of ways to discover new knowledge related to the intellectual structure of the field. The study represents a new method of citation analysis, that is studying only sole journal citations. In this new method, the researcher seeks to find scientific and intra-discipline communication relations among the papers of Library Herald, being published during a five-year period. For such a goal, the author extracted required data to answer questions like, what was the most interesting topic during the studied period?, who has received the most citations and for which topic and what is the journal's current dominant scope? Is the journal welcomed by international contributors, or it has just dealt with local interests?The finding shows that among 130 examined materials we had a mean of 26 materials for each year. The journal has published 120 original papers during five years. 88% of contributors were from India. The journal had only 16 international contributions during the course of five years. As a scientific journal, the author thinks, Library Herald is a prestigious journal in the field of LIS which is worth to be subscribed by university libraries. Few numbers of international contributors have provided an opportunity to young researchers to submit their manuscripts.",

Community needs information to make the best use of resources available to them and get direct or indirect help in solving their day to day problems. In Bangladesh, majority of population lives in villages. It is experienced that many of government programmes and services do not reach to common people who is living in villages. Sometimes, community people get information through traditional library system. But rural communities do not get the ICT facilities due to absence of ICT features in the traditional library system. This study focuses the problems associated with the provision of community information services through public library and need the establishment of ICT based community information centre. An attempt has been made to assess how the community information Centres are giving modern information facilities and explores how CIC (Community Information Centre) can be strap up to promote development of rural communities in Bangladesh. It believes that establishment of CIC will make community people life easier to enter information arena through ICT and ensure overall development of Bangladesh. The findings also advocate to make a sound coordination with CIC and rural libraries and suggests some effective measures for the improvement of community information services in Bangladesh.",

Unfortunately, the libraries were made victims of plunder and destruction during the invasion of the kings and the ignorance of the Britishers to the cause of library development perhaps is the resultant, the Delhi does not provide much information on the dissemination of information and the role libraries must have played in different settlements.

The study population was chosen from all universities in Tehran holding high graduate courses in their schedules. Five universities were of this study's population and all dissertations related to LIS students supporting the study. The results supported the high use of print Farsi books versus print and digital English books; the researchers found no Farsi digital book use. For the case of measuring the relation of citations with the age of dissertations, the authors set three categories for dissertations: as the oldest dissertations were 6 years old and newest ones were 1 year old, so the authors divided 6 by 2 and thus 3 categories were generated: 1–2 years old, 3–4 years old, and 5–6 years old. It was found that there is significance between newest dissertations with digital English book use. In terms of interrelation of citation between universities dissertations, no significant correlation emerged.",

The use of information is so complex that there cannot be a single system to cope up with the task of effective retrieval without assessing their specific needs. This is applicable to every discipline such as social sciences, humanities and science and technology. The information use pattern by the academicians of Fashion Technology has been taken into consideration in this study. In India, education in fashion technology has been given due importance at the national level. The Ministry of Textiles, Government of India constituted a group of seven institutions exclusively for fashion technology related studies. Hence for this purpose, these seven centres of National Institute of Fashion Technology in India situated in different parts of India have been identified for this paper.",

Increase in journals’ prices and constant budget for the last two decades have posed a challenge for libraries to maintain their journal subscriptions up to a sufficient level to support their research and development activities. In the meantime, publication of scholarly articles in public domain through Web has provided new ways to scholarly world. Various means of OA have been discussed with supporting business models. Authors have gone through various studies which were made in the recent past to show impact of OA towards its use and citation in scholarship and research. The studies have shown that OA helps to increase the citation impact of journals and is helping to make scientific research more visible and accessible, thus affecting tremendously the scientific communication. Authors hope that OA will have a bright future.",

For performing the study, a descriptive survey was used and a self-designed questionnaire was prepared for the study. For validity, the questionnaire was referred to some informants to evaluate the items. Then, the questionnaires were distributed through LIS students of Tarbiat Moalem and Shahid Beheshti universities and finally 68 valid questionnaires returned. The findings showed that there is a significant relation between the theoretical instruction of library software and the practical training. It was revealed that the kind of library software affects to the LIS students’ satisfaction. The study concluded that despite the lack of financial resources, LIS departments should acquire some up to date library software for practical training, because the theoretical instruction is insufficient and will cause fostering inept librarians.",

The paper aims at giving realistic examples taken from various library operations as experienced at the library. It may be observed in the following paragraphs how effective and simple it is to apply this software in a in-house library set up. The software helps a upcoming, new library professional to easily understand and initiate various library operations without much dependency on others. From the screen shots one can understand how the data entry, issue and deposits, report generation and search functions can be carried out. It may be noted that, at present this software has been made commercial. When the authors experimented it was a free ware software.",

A descriptive survey research was performed using a structured questionnaire and distributed for data gathering. The population of this study consists of public libraries in Tehran which are around 80 in number. Of these, 60 libraries were selected randomly and distributed among these identified sixty libraries. Of these sixty libraries, 38 libraries responded and returned the filled questionnaires. Findings of the survey reveal that these libraries do not have any independent policy. Library managers of these libraries believe that public libraries need more professional manpower to organise effective library services. As of today most of the public library buildings are not suitable for organising library services. At the end, some suggestions are made for improving the prevalent condition of public libraries in Tehran.",

While historically all societies have thrived on the basis of knowledge, it is only from the second decade of the 20th century, knowledge has taken the central place in all the developmental process. It is because of the huge investments in knowledge creation and use, through Information and Communication Technology. A new Knowledge Universe is perceived which comprises Knowledge created by R & D, tacit knowledge of individuals and embedded knowledge in natural resources and artifacts.The Indian Society is poised for economic growth with the liberation economic policy of the Government. Economic pundits predict India will emerge as a strong economic power in the next few decades. Despite numerous problems which are threatening the pace of economic growth, the government has established the National Knowledge Commission (NKC) (2005) to create the Knowledge strength for application in the diverse spheres of developmental activities. A knowledge Pentagon is visualized with five focal areas viz., Access, Concepts, Creation, Applications and Services which constitute a Knowledge base. Concrete proposals for E-Governance have been recommended to reengineer the government machinery to be citizen centered.One of the Working Groups of NKC is for Libraries and Information Services. Ten recommendations have been made with 5 special annexures in an elite group of professionals and experts. It is likely that a new class of professionals would be turned out in the next few decades who will manage Library and Information Services in the light of socio-economic development processes suggested by NKC. The Knowledge Society of the 21st century will throw new opportunities and challenges to the library and information professional community.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of electronic information resources has led to an increased demand on libraries to deliver more in terms of services and products, and to do so faster the enhanced services offered by libraries have raised the expectations of patrons. Technologically sophisticated patrons are frequently knowledgeable about the new resource and their capabilities, often well before a library's staff. The versatility offered by electronic resources may also lead patrons to have unrealistic expectation about what technology can provide. The proliferation of electronic resources demanding professionals to assume greater responsibility far keeping pace with technology. As the library become the provider of information in a variety of formats, it is essential that librarians should know how to use the new technology required to access the information in those new formats particularly when that technology has been available to patrons whom the librarian may very well need to assist. This article is an attempt to explore some of the conceptual and theoretical issues raised by the proliferation of electronic resources and also highlights the importance of Collection Development, Consortia and the Role of Library professionals.",

As teachers in universities play a vital role in providing up to date information with latest technologies, they have to be good users of such information. Hence, it is worth studying the use of electronic information by the university teachers. The necessary data for the study was collected from a sample of 50 university teachers. A pre-structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. The study reveals that the availability of electronic information and the satisfaction of the teachers in the available resources are not high. Non-availability of full text, lack of time and lack of system speed are the most important barriers for the teachers in using the electronic information.",

It requires that schools take action that may require curriculum adjustments and/or changes as well as providing choice to leave a failing school to one that is meeting NCLB criteria. This article describes how mastery learning principles applied throughout the curriculum can support the NCLB legislation. Mastery learning has been a proven strategy to maximize students’ effort in achieving proficiency in learning. NCLB legislation is aimed at assuring that all children reach a level of proficiency in their learning. But the legislation does not determine how school districts can accomplish this task. The paper suggests that by implementing mastery learning principles each student can reach a level of proficiency and therefore will support effectiveness of NCLB legislation.",

Single stage random sampling with equal allocation method is used to select 550 managers from the 66 licensed commercial banks. It reveals that there is a significant positive relationship between academic qualifications and information utilisation in decision-making of the respondents (r = 0.88, P < 0.05). Information accessibility and utilisation, when taken together significantly influences decision-making of the respondents (F = 48.67, df = 2; 507, P < 0.05). Also, each of the two factors independently has a significant influence on decision-making of the respondents information accessibility (= 0.6214; df = 507, T = 10.71, P < 0.05) and information utilization (= 0.8246. df = 507, T = 12.49 P < 0.05). The study also shows that information utilisation has a greater relative influence than information accessibility on decision-making of the respondents. Information accessibility and utilisation have significant positive multiple relationship with decision-making of the respondents (R = 0.8428, P <0.05). It is therefore recommended that the management should make relevant information accessible on time for the use of managers for improved decision-making in the Nigerian commercial banks.",

Mentions several of the challenges facing libraries in determining their present and future roles in their nation's information infrastructure and in a global information infrastructure. Web based bibliographic services provided in the British Library and Library of Congress have been discussed. Libraries are major providers of information. They have a crucial role to play particularly in the era of information technology and wired world. The undergoing shift caused by changing user needs not only affects the technical services of libraries but also streamline the library services that are being offered to the public. Need for availability of national bibliographic databases in machine-readable form on the Web would provide better bibliographic organization and control of material. Some suggestions for improving the computerized bibliographic services at national library and strategies for implementation have been put forth.",

Questionnaire and observation methods were employed to accumulate data for the study. The study reveals that various categories of records are created and kept in the Library. The findings show that the records programme in the Library is okay but not yet complete. The paper therefore recommends that the Library should establish a central records centre, archives and provide necessary facilities like biological agent control and others for improvement of records management in the Library.",

Web and web-based technologies in the last couple of years have attacked on the boundaries of Library and Information Work. Consequently the traditional image of LIS professionals is rapidly changing and widening into a knowledge centre and a knowledge manager. The modern library system, keeping in mind that “the right information needs to be in the hands of the right people at the right place” and knowledge is the new expandable source of the economic wealth and a critical asset to an organization, has transformed their external and internal functioning and management. Knowledge Management (KM) is not about technology management but rather than about deciding what information and knowledge is critical to the success of the organization. The emerging issues of Knowledge Management need to be taken seriously in changing perspectives as challenges by the LIS professionals. It has widely and undoubtedly been accepted and proved from various studies that future shall be knowledge based. Therefore, knowledge management, content management, content engineering through LIS professionals shall play a significant role in the 21st century. The paper discusses in detail the various facets of knowledge management such as Evolution and Concept of Knowledge Management, Knowledge Management Technologies and Tools, LIS professionals as Knowledge Manager, and challenges for the LIS professional in the electronic age.",

But as far as Information Sector is concerned there is a paradoxical situation amongst its major constituent agencies i.e., Information Architects and the Information Managers, whereby the former has responded with tremendous changes with total transformation of marketing strategy from that of traditional to a modern one. But the Information Managers are slow to respond in this regard and thus there is growing challenge for them to be taken over by their counterparts.",

For more than 70% respondents, the librarian was effective in solving their problems. However, only 43.5% considered him partially or fully up-to-date in the use of IT. Although the perception of male and female sociologists does not differ significantly, but there is a significant difference in the perception of professors, reader/associate professors, lecturer/assistant professors, researchers, and those working in other type of institutions.",

In this paper, a global view of the data generated in libraries, and the variety of decisions that those data can inform is presented.

The analysis of data reveals great variations in the practices being followed in selection and allotment of topics, methodology for preparation and presentation, system of evaluation and assessment of dissertations and Viva-voce examination (where associated with the evaluation of dissertations). There is a consensus among universities to treat Dissertation, as an integral part of MLIS syllabus in all universities and it must be made compulsory in Universities where it is elective at present. Recommends avoidance of duplication in selection of topics and suggests creation of database of Dissertations submitted in LIS schools in a city at local level and bibliographical control of MLIS Dissertations at National level; evolving of suitable policy for allowing students to prepare and submit dissertations in regional languages, where MLIS education is being imparted in such languages. It is also recommended that some standardization may be achieved in the matter of evaluation system for Dissertations. Some guidelines by bodies like UGC, are considered necessary in this regard.",

But there are several problems that may arise while accessing available resources of library using traditional way or approach. In the age of Information Technology, by applying IT in libraries the way by which resources can be accessed gets simplified. In short, there is formation of Virtual Library.

The database maintained by virtual library can be accessed globally by everybody irrespective of geographical boundaries. In what follows, there is explanation of one of such design for network called as JALINET, Jalgaon Library Network and reveals how the libraries are worth to use the new concept of information technology to cater the needs of information seekers and how it is one of the channels to receive useful information.",
